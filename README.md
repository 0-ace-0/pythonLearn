# pythonLearn
This program is designed to teach you to think about the way Python can be used with Object Oriented programs (OOP). 
It takes a list of WORDS (line 5-6 & 29-30) from a website, which are used to make random artefacts, which might be used
in your OOP. 
Those artefacts are shown one at a time, and you have the opportunity to answer what they mean in English.
After that the correct answer is shown. And you can compare to your answer.
